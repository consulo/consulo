    If you don't want the "lightbulb" icon to appear in the editor to indicate a particular fix,
      open the list of available actions by pressing <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ShowIntentionActions;</span> and toggle the lightbulb icon
      near the text of the action into inactive state by clicking it with the mouse.<br><br>
      There will be no lightbulb shown for this particular action but you will be still able to use it with the
      <span class="shortcut">&shortcut:ShowIntentionActions;</span> shortcut.
