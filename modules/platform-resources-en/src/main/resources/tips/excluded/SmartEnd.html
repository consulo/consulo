When you press the &shortcut:EditorLineEnd; key on an empty line, the caret is positioned to the place where you most
likely will start typing on this line (Smart End). For example, when you have
<pre>
  public void f(){

  }
</pre>
and press &shortcut:EditorLineEnd; anywhere on the empty line between braces, the caret is positioned to one indent to the right from
the position just under "public".
<br>
You must have the correct indent size and other settings set in the correspondence to your code style preferences in
the "Source Code" options.
