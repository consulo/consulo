  <p>&productName; lets you jump from your check-in comment to an issue in your task tracker.</p> 
  <p>All you have to do is to define issue navigation patterns in the <span class="control">Settings | Version Control</span> dialog:</p> 
  <p class="image"> <icon src="consulo.ide.tipOfDay.impl.TipOfDayIconGroup@issueNavigation1" width="565" height="360"></icon></p>
  <p>When you commit a changelist, and type the check-in comment, make sure it matches one of your issue navigation patterns. Later, when you browse through the changelists in the repository, such comments turn into hyperlinks:</p> 
  <p class="image"> <icon src="consulo.ide.tipOfDay.impl.TipOfDayIconGroup@issueNavigation" width="282" height="80"></icon></p>
  <p>Clicking a hyperlink brings you directly to an issue in your task tracker.</p>
