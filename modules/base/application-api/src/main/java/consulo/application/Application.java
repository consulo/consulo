/**
 * Provides access to core application-wide functionality and methods for working with the IDE
 * thread model. The thread model defines two main types of actions which can access the PSI and other
 * IDE data structures: read actions (which do not modify the data) and write actions (which modify
 * some data).<p>
 * You can call methods requiring read access from the Swing event-dispatch thread without using
 * {@link #runReadAction} method. If you need to invoke such methods from another thread you have to use
 * {@link #runReadAction}. Multiple read actions can run at the same time without locking each other.
 * <p>
 * Write actions can be called only from the Swing thread using {@link #runWriteAction} method.
 * If there are read actions running at this moment <code>runWriteAction</code> is blocked until they are completed.
